          I am originally from the Inland Empire (a region just outside of Los
          Angeles) but I moved up to the Bay Area for college. Although the
          COVID-19 pandemic hit and made me move around a lot, I have learned
          how to make the best of the situations I am in. Here is both the fun
          and professional side of me!

          I am a rugby player and I have been playing for about 2 years now. I
          have played for the San Francisco Fog team. Rugby has taught me
          a lot about teamwork, discipline, and resilience. It has also given
          me the opportunity to travel and meet people from all over the world.

          I am also a multimedia reporter and I have been working on my Master's Degree in journalism about
          the Bay Area for the past two years. I have been taking photos of the
          people, places, and events that make the Bay Area unique. I have also
          been writing articles to accompany my photos with <a href="https://localnewsmatters.org/author/andres-larios-bay-city-news/"> Bay City News and Local News Matters </a href>. I hope to continue
          working on this project and to share it with others.
