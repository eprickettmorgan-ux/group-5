      <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-white"> Hi I'm Ellie and the AI that I can't figure out how to turn off on VS Code keeps creepily auto-suggesting text. It knows I'm a graduate student, but it thinks I'm a the University of New Mexico. I would write in this description the institution we all know that I'm attending, but I hate the machine too much to help it out. My brother is an electrical engineer, and he also hates AI. Unfortunately, his job recently mandated that he incorporate a paid version of Claude into his programming workflow. My brother resisted this for a long time, but he's settled for just bullying the AI, namely by asking it questions about Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe.</div>

     <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-white">Last week when he did that the AI responded to one of his questions about Volpe by saying:</div>

      <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-white"> I think this is beautiful because I've always known my brother is annoying, but now the robot knows it too. </div>

     <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-white"> For context Anthony Volpe had a really bad season last year, the kind that you should be sent down to triple A for. It's partially because he tore his labrum and the Yankees management didn't notice it until months into the injury. That meant that Anthony Volpe played one of the worst seasons in MLB, leading the league in errors. It also kinda wasn't his fault, but he still had to suck very publicly on a team with a fanbase full of neanderthals.</div>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption"> An example of the kind memes about Volpe being made by Yankees fans.</figcaption>
     </figure>
     
     <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-white">You should also know that my brother has decided that his mental health is deeply tied to whether or not Anthony Volpe succeeds in baseball. This is not a good way to live a happy life. The robot has figured out Henry's love for Tony. We know this because it's started to come up with outlandish predictions for Volpe's 2026 season, like "AL MVP" or "still on the team." This has not endeared the robot to my brother, because he knows it is lying.</div>
