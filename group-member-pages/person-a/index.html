      <p>Hi I'm Ellie and the AI that I can't figure out how to turn off on VS Code keeps creepily auto-suggesting text. It knows I'm a graduate student, but it thinks I'm a the University of New Mexico. I would write in this description the institution we all know that I'm attending, but I hate the machine too much to help it out. My brother is an electrical engineer, and he also hates AI despite the fact that the company he works at mandated that it be a part of his programming workflow. My brother bullies the AI by asking it non sequiturs, namely about Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe. Last week when he did that the AI responded to one of his questions about Volpe by saying, "can we go back to writing firmware?" which I think is beautiful because I've always known my brother is annoying but now the robot knows it too. For context Anthony Volpe had a really bad season last year, the kind that you should be sent down to triple A for. It's partially because he tore his labrum and the Yankees management didn't notice it until months into the injury. That meant that Anthony Volpe played one of the worst seasons in MLB, leading the league in errors. You should also know that my brother has decided that his mental health is deeply tied to whether or not Anthony Volpe succeeds in baseball. This is not a good way to live a happy life. The robot has figured this out about Henry, so it has decided more recently to start complimenting Volpe, which has not endeared the robot to my brother, because he knows it is lying. </p>
